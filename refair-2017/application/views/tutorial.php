     <h1>Welcome to the Prism Tutorial</h1>
          <h4>Introduction of online research as just redoing search on a smaller sample, privately</h2>
          <br/><hr/>
     <p>With "Greased Lightning" on the speakers, I am now ready to undertake the majestic quest that is writing a tutorial for Prism</p><br/>
          <p>Prism is designed as a tool that is supposed to aid research. By research I will define a situation in which you've found unsatisfying results from your primary search engine. Prism is not fast. Prism will, on average, work for some tens of seconds to return your research results. </p>
<p>This means that prism is a tool that is supposed to be really as non-intrusive as possible. The goal for Prism is to get your average search activity (input search term, scan results, order by most significant) and automate it on your own host, be it USB, VM or a hosted application. Prism, basically, is a Linux distribution with a built in private search engine that will require your API-Keys to use services. Right now, we are hosted on a single VM on amazon. A USB-Key is in the works</p>
<h2>Let's get down to business and explain the usage pattern for prism</h2>
          <img src="<?php echo base_url("assets/images/prismtut1.png"); ?>" style="width:700px;margin-right:10px;;"/>
          <p> The grayish window is your input search term. It is the source of search results that you, as the user, are in control of. We are calling several APIs in some manner to aid you in researching a certain topic on the web. The easiest way to do it was apply keyword ordering. </p>
          <p>By scanning the search results automatically and with no memory except for your input keywords (which are also lost after the searches as we are currently considering your personal history of search) and ordering them, you are capable of applying a three word statistical prism on your search results. The red keyword adds you a disambiguation from DuckDuckGo. The green and blue ones are necessary in order to map the data correctly, just as you would in a global addressing system.</p><h2>It's online research - you just redo your search, privately, using a web service that you can host anywhere with a USB-bootable computer</h2>
          <p><strong>Let me introduce some use cases for research topics and results</strong><p>
          <img src="<?php echo base_url("assets/images/prismtut2.png"); ?>" style="width:700px;margin-right:10px;"/>
<p> I have to clarify first, that this engine works as expected when used correctly - I would abstain from using it as your primary search engine due to performance. What Prism gives you is an automated sift through your search results, according to the keywords you have declared. It is great when you are researching things for coding, science, engineering, but also historical texts, music. We can't apply this method to images yet, as we are not technologically capable.</p><p>Thus, let me begin by introducing some factual use cases that I have prepared</p>
          <h2>Use case number one - carbon nanotubes</h2>
          <p>The common problem with CNT growth is the precursors. What if I could check what precursors can be used in 700 degrees to make CNTs grow?</p>
          <img src="<?php echo base_url("assets/images/prismtut3.png"); ?>" style="width:700px;margin-right:10px;"/>
          <img src="<?php echo base_url("assets/images/prismtut4.png"); ?>" style="width:700px;margin-right:10px;"/>
          <img src="<?php echo base_url("assets/images/prismtut5.png"); ?>" style="width:700px;margin-right:10px;"/>
          <p>I have intentionally shown you the spectrum of the results right now. Please understand that all Prism does <i>is find keywords in a text file and then orders the results according to your key count.</i></p><p>Nothing more, nothing less. It is truly your ingenuity that can make Prism work great, or make it not work at all. We have added error codes for you to see which APIs are at fault should something bad happen</p><h3>Please be patient while Prism crunches your results. It's just a technology - and we will make it faster as soon as we are able to</h3>
<p>The second result from Prism tells us you can grow CNTS in 700 degrees Celsius using PALM OIL. </p>
          <img src="<?php echo base_url("assets/images/prismtut6.png"); ?>" style="width:700px;margin-right:10px;"/><br/><hr/>
          <img src="<?php echo base_url("assets/images/prismtut7.png"); ?>" style="width:1100px;margin-right:10px;"/><br/>
<p>Cool. And thats the first instance of how you can use Prism correctly. Let us carry on - and you can easily reproduce the results right now, but remember there's only a 100 searches per day now!</p>
          <h2>Use case number two - The issue of CodeIgniter and Sessions<h2>
          <p>For those of you that use CodeIgniter (which I've learned a month ago), you probably must have checked all the stack overflows about passing data with JSON to controllers and back. Well, let's see if there is some juice in Prism to get you coder satisfaction</p><p>Mind you, I'm not a software developer. I just build bombs</p>
<p>What is really nice about Prism is that it's <b>uncluttered</b>. We plan to be pay only to enter the service, and this is still beta. Let's get on with Codeigniter.<br/><br/>

<p>We aim to get the advertising content out of your way by establishing a low cost monthly fee that will let us develop the app further</p>
<p>We don't want investor money. We want client money</p>
